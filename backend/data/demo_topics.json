That moment of insight cements understanding far better than rote learning.\n\n**Classic puzzle (try it!)**:\n> Three missionaries and three cannibals must cross a river using a boat that holds at most two people. If cannibals ever outnumber missionaries on either bank, the missionaries will be eaten. How do they all cross safely?\n\n**Why puzzles teach better**:\n- You DISCOVER the concept yourself\n- Struggle creates memorable learning\n- Multiple approaches reveal mathematical structure\n- Fun keeps you engaged longer\n\n**The Masters**:\n- **Martin Gardner** (1914-2010): His \"Mathematical Games\" column in Scientific American ran 25 years and inspired generations of mathematicians.\n- **Boris Kordemsky**: *The Moscow Puzzles* (1956) brought Russian puzzle traditions to the world.\n- **Henry Dudeney** (1857-1930): British puzzler whose newspaper columns and books are still enjoyed today.\n- **Sam Loyd** (1841-1911): Created the famous 15-puzzle and countless others.\n\n**Start with these books**:\n- *My Best Mathematical and Logic Puzzles* by Gardner\n- *The Moscow Puzzles* by Kordemsky\n- *Amusements in Mathematics* by Dudeney\n- *Professor Stewart's Cabinet of Mathematical Curiosities*\n\n**The tradition continues**: Modern puzzles like Sudoku, KenKen, and logic grid puzzles all teach mathematical thinking disguised as games!",

Each land mass is a node; each bridge is an edge. For such a walk to exist, at most 2 nodes can have an odd number of edges.

This plays with our assumptions about what clocks \"should\" measure—a reminder that definitions are conventions!\n\n**\"Sentence first—verdict afterwards!\"**:\nThe Queen's trial inverts logical order. In real logic:\n1. Evidence → 2. Verdict → 3. Sentence\n\nThe Queen does: 3 → 2 → 1. Carroll shows how absurd reversed reasoning looks.\n\n**The Caterpillar's Identity Puzzle**:\n> *\"Who are YOU?\"*\n\nAlice struggles to prove she's herself after changing size repeatedly. This anticipates the philosophical \"Ship of Theseus\" problem: if everything about you changes, are you still you?\n\n**Tweedledee's Logical Trickery**:\n> *\"If it was so, it might be; and if it were so, it would be; but as it isn't, it ain't. That's logic.\"*\n\nThis is actually VALID conditional logic, just stated confusingly!\n\n**Carroll's serious logic work**: He wrote *Symbolic Logic* and invented logic diagrams still used today.

Most are gibberish, but somewhere exists every truth, every lie, every biography (including yours!). Borges calculated: 25 characters, 410 pages of 40 lines of 80 characters = 25^(1,312,000) books. A number so vast it makes the atoms in the universe look tiny.\n\n**The mathematical insight**: This is a finite but incomprehensibly large number. True infinity is even stranger!\n\n**David Foster Wallace: Everything and More**\nThe novelist wrote an entire book about the history of infinity in mathematics. He called Cantor's work on infinite sets \"the most beautiful and profound achievement in modern mathematics.\"\n\n**Lewis Carroll's Infinite Regress**:\n> *\"What the Tortoise Said to Achilles\"*\n\nCarroll wrote a famous logic paper disguised as a dialogue. To prove anything, you need rules. But then you need rules about applying rules. And rules about those rules... forever!\n\n**Jonathan Swift's Scale**:\n*Gulliver's Travels* plays with size ratios (1:12 in Lilliput).

(Probably myth, but the physics would work.)\n\n**The math**: A parabola is all points equally distant from a fixed point (focus) and a line (directrix).

Cantor proved this with his diagonal argument—mind-blowing stuff.\n\n**Why \"real\"?**: To distinguish from \"imaginary\" numbers (involving √−1). Bad naming! Imaginary numbers are just as legitimate.\n\n**The completeness property**: Real numbers have no \"gaps.\" Every point on the line IS a real number.

You don't NEED to update all parameters—a low-rank approximation captures most of the useful change!\n\n**The numbers**: If rank r = 8 and dimensions are 4096:\n- Full fine-tuning: 16 million parameters per layer\n- LoRA: (4096 × 8) + (8 × 4096) = 65,536 parameters per layer\n- That's **250× fewer** trainable parameters!\n\n**SVD connection**: Singular Value Decomposition shows that any matrix can be approximated by low-rank matrices. LoRA exploits this by learning the low-rank update directly.\n\n**Real impact**: You can fine-tune a 7B parameter model on a single GPU. Hobbyists can now customize large language models at home!\n\n**Fun fact**: LoRA was published in 2021 and immediately became the standard for efficient fine-tuning.",

We combine them with AND (∧), OR (∨), and NOT (¬).\n\n**If-then (implication)** is true except in one case:\nIf P is true and Q is false, then “P → Q” is false. Otherwise it’s true.\n\n---\n\n🧪 **Proof by Contradiction**\n\nAssume the opposite of what you want, show it leads to a contradiction, and conclude the original statement is true.\n\n---\n\n🧱 **Mathematical Induction**\n\n1) Prove a base case (like n=1)\n2) Assume it’s true for n, then prove for n+1\n\n---\n\n🔎 **Quantifiers**\n\n• **For all (∀)**: every element\n• **There exists (∃)**: at least one element\n\nThey’re the backbone of formal statements like “for all x, there exists y...”",
