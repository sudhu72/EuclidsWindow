{"instruction": "Now give one counterexample where a graph is connected but not Hamiltonian.", "input": "Learner level: teen", "output": "A star graph K1,n (n>=3) is connected but not Hamiltonian. Any cycle would require revisiting the center to include multiple leaves."}
{"instruction": "Ask me a 2-question quiz on imaginary numbers.", "input": "Learner level: teen", "output": "Quiz Q1: What does i represent? Q2: Simplify i^4. Answers: i is the square root of -1, and i^4 = 1."}
{"instruction": "Give a kid-friendly explanation of fractions.", "input": "Learner level: kids", "output": "A fraction is a way to share something fairly. If you cut a pizza into 4 equal slices and eat 1 slice, you ate 1/4. The top number tells how many slices you have, and the bottom number tells total equal slices."}
{"instruction": "Can you explain that in simpler words with one analogy?", "input": "Learner level: teen", "output": "Think of walking around a circle. Multiplying by e^(i*theta) means rotating by angle theta. At theta=pi, you land at -1, so adding 1 gives 0."}
{"instruction": "Give me a 2-question quiz to check understanding.", "input": "Learner level: teen", "output": "Q1: What is e^(i*0)? Q2: What is e^(i*pi)? Answers: 1 and -1."}
{"instruction": "Explain Hamiltonian cycle briefly.", "input": "Learner level: teen", "output": "A Hamiltonian cycle visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex."}
{"instruction": "Can you show one worked example for theta = pi/2?", "input": "Learner level: teen", "output": "Use Euler's formula: e^(i*theta)=cos(theta)+i*sin(theta). For theta=pi/2: cos(pi/2)=0 and sin(pi/2)=1, so e^(i*pi/2)=i."}
{"instruction": "Can you slow down and show each algebra step separately?", "input": "Learner level: college", "output": "Step 1: Expand (x+h)^3 = x^3+3x^2h+3xh^2+h^3. Step 2: Substitute and cancel x^3. Step 3: Divide by h. Step 4: Take h->0. Final: 3x^2+2."}
{"instruction": "Explain Euler's identity with visualization.", "input": "Learner level: teen", "output": "Euler's identity is e^(i*pi)+1=0. It connects exponential growth and circular motion in the complex plane."}
{"instruction": "Differentiate x^3 + 2x from first principles.", "input": "Learner level: college", "output": "f'(x)=lim_{h->0}[(x+h)^3+2(x+h)-x^3-2x]/h = lim_{h->0}[3x^2+3xh+h^2+2] = 3x^2+2."}
{"instruction": "Show one worked example for solving x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0.", "input": "Learner level: teen", "output": "Factor the quadratic: x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3). Set each factor to zero. So the roots are x = 2 and x = 3. Verify: 2^2 - 5*2 + 6 = 0 and 3^2 - 5*3 + 6 = 0."}
{"instruction": "Explain Hamiltonian cycle intuition with one analogy.", "input": "Learner level: teen", "output": "A Hamiltonian cycle is like planning a city tour that visits each landmark exactly once and returns to the start. The challenge is finding a route that never repeats landmarks while still forming a closed loop."}
{"instruction": "Explain Euler's identity in plain English.", "input": "Learner level: teen", "output": "Euler's identity connects five important constants: e, i, pi, 1, and 0. It says e^(i*pi) + 1 = 0. You can think of it as a bridge between exponential growth and rotation on the complex plane."}
{"instruction": "Can you derive the derivative of x^3 from first principles?", "input": "Learner level: college", "output": "Using the limit definition, f'(x)=lim_{h->0}[(x+h)^3-x^3]/h. Expand: x^3+3x^2h+3xh^2+h^3-x^3. Divide by h to get 3x^2+3xh+h^2. Take h->0, result is 3x^2."}
